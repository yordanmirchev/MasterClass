Example input:

Printer printer = new Printer(50, true);
System.out.println(printer.addToner(50));
System.out.println("initial page count = " +printer.getPagesPrinted());
int pagesPrinted = printer.printPages(4);
System.out.println("Pages printed was " + pagesPrinted +" new total print count for printer = " +printer.getPagesPrinted());
pagesPrinted = printer.printPages(2);
System.out.println("Pages printed was " + pagesPrinted +" new total print count for printer = " +printer.getPagesPrinted());
Example output:

100
initial page count = 0
Printing in duplex mode
Pages printed was 2 new total print count for printer = 2
Printing in duplex mode
Pages printed was 1 new total print count for printer = 3
Tips:

Remember to only paste the code from Printer class into the exercise evaluator.
The Main class does not need to be pasted in.

You can include a message in the printPages method which informs the user that the printer
is printing in duplex mode if duplex is equal to "true" if you want.

When calculating pagesToPrint if duplex is equal to "true"
 remember that there are two operators which can help you with this.
  The division "/" operator divides a number and returns only the quotient
   without any remainder. And the modulo "%" operator divides the number and
   returns only the remainder, whether 0 or otherwise.
