And for the third class, HealthyBurger,
there will be four(4) additional member variables called

 healthyExtra1Name,healthyExtra1Price,
 healthyExtra2Name, and healthyExtra2Price.
 The names are type String and the prices are type double.

 The constructor for this class accepts two(2) parameters for meat and price.

  Those are set in the constructor along with an appropriate name for the type of burger.

Two methods, addHealthyAddition1 and addHealthyAddition2 should be created that each accept a name and price for the addition,
allowing for up to two(2) addons to the basic healthy burger.
And finally the itemizeHamburger method created in the Hamburger
class should be overridden to generate
a message appropriate to the type of burger along with any addons.
The method also returns the total price of the healthy burger of type double.

Example input:

Hamburger hamburger = new Hamburger("Basic", "Sausage", 3.56, "White");
hamburger.addHamburgerAddition1("Tomato", 0.27);
hamburger.addHamburgerAddition2("Lettuce", 0.75);
hamburger.addHamburgerAddition3("Cheese", 1.13);
System.out.println("Total Burger price is " + hamburger.itemizeHamburger());

HealthyBurger healthyBurger = new HealthyBurger("Bacon", 5.67);
healthyBurger.addHamburgerAddition1("Egg", 5.43);
healthyBurger.addHealthyAddition1("Lentils", 3.41);
System.out.println("Total Healthy Burger price is  " + healthyBurger.itemizeHamburger());

DeluxeBurger db = new DeluxeBurger();
db.addHamburgerAddition3("Should not do this", 50.53);
System.out.println("Total Deluxe Burger price is " + db.itemizeHamburger());
